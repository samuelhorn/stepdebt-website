      <h1>StepDebt — A Smarter Step Tracker for Real Life</h1>
      <p>
        Miss your step goal? Those steps become step debt. Walk extra another
        day? You pay it back — or even save steps for later.
      </p><p>
        StepDebt is a minimalist step tracker designed for consistency, not
        perfection. No streak pressure. No guilt. Just a simple system that fits
        real life.
